A specialized workshop‚Äîthe second in a growing series‚Äîwas held in the spring of 2024 in Guntersblum. This event was funded by the *Begegnungszonen* program of the [Joachim Herz Foundation](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en/), which aims to *‚Äúsupport the design and implementation of interdisciplinary events for young scientists.‚Äù* This mission perfectly aligns with the goals of the workshop series.

By bringing together 16 doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds, the workshop created an interdisciplinary environment in which participants were exposed to state-of-the-art methods at the interface of machine learning and the life sciences. Over several days, attendees explored concepts beyond their usual research domains, fostering cross-disciplinary exchange and collaboration.

The 2024 workshop focused on simulation-based inference, a set of techniques that have become increasingly important for understanding complex biological systems. Prof. [Pedro Gon√ßalves](https://goncalveslab.sites.vib.be/en) from the Neuro-Electronics Research Flanders (NERF) Institute served as the lead instructor. He was joined by his doctoral student, Anastasia Krouglova, and doctoral student, Guy Moss, from the lab of Prof. Jakob Macke (University of T√ºbingen), who contributed practical sessions and mentoring.

This report briefly introduces the workshop series‚Äô motivation and underlying ideas, highlights the importance and impact of simulation-based inference, and presents representative examples of the students‚Äô work during the event.
