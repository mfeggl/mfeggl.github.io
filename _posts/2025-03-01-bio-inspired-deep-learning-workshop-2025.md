A specialized workshopâ€”the third in a growing seriesâ€”was held in the spring of 2025 in Guntersblum. This event was generously funded by the [Joachim Herz Foundation](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en/) - with the initiative aiming to create spaces where early-career researchers can connect across disciplines, perfectly aligning with the goals of the workshop series.

The 2025 workshop brought together 16 doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds in machine learning and the life sciences. Over several intensive days, participants were immersed in state-of-the-art methods at the intersection of these fields, fostering an environment where they could explore concepts beyond their usual research areas.

This yearâ€™s focus was on dimensionality reduction techniquesâ€”a crucial set of tools for uncovering hidden structure in complex, high-dimensional data. [Dr. Angus Chadwick](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/achadwic/index.html) from the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, served as the lead instructor. He was joined by his doctoral student, Isabel Cornacchia, and postdoctoral fellow, Arthur Pellegrino, who contributed practical tutorials and mentoring sessions.

The workshop included lectures on the motivation and applications of simulation-based inference, hands-on coding exercises, and discussions of emerging methods. Participants also presented their own projects, demonstrating how dimensionality reduction could be applied to problems in genomics, neuroscience, and biophysics.
