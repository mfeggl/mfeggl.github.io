A specialized workshop‚Äîthe first in this series‚Äîwas held in the spring of 2023 in Guntersblum. This event was funded by the *Begegnungszonen* program of the [Joachim Herz Foundation](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en/) and was designed to provide a novel opportunity at the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. The spirit of the funding program supported the workshop‚Äôs central aim: *‚Äúsupporting the design and implementation of interdisciplinary events for young scientists.‚Äù*

To this end, 16 doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers were brought together to explore relevant and compelling questions in the field of biologically inspired deep learning. Over several days, participants engaged with foundational and emerging ideas, fostering an interdisciplinary environment that encouraged the exchange of perspectives across research areas.

The 2023 workshop focused on the credit assignment problem‚Äîone of the central challenges in understanding how learning systems adjust their internal representations in response to feedback. Prof. [Ponte Costa](https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/rui-ponte-costa) from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bristol served as the lead instructor. He was joined by his doctoral students, Will Greedy and Joseph Pemberton, who contributed tutorials and practical sessions.

This report briefly introduces the motivation and underlying ideas behind the workshop series, highlights the importance of credit assignment in bio-inspired deep learning, and presents representative examples of the students‚Äô work during the event.
